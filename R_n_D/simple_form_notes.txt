The trick here is to do all of the work creating the form in a separate
function (that's the intended approach in the game). Separate functions or
macros may be used to process the interaction, the submitted value, etc.
Validation confuses me -- seems like its automatic. let's play with it and
find out!

main
*****
data:
char username[];
FIELD** fields
FORM* prompt_for_name
WINDOW* form_win
WINDOW* form_subwin

logic:
initialize curses
draw_form() - pass fields, prompt_for_name, form_win, form_subwin
    set_fields - pass fields
    set_field_attrs - pass fields
    create_form - pass fields, prompt_for_name (a one-liner?)
    create_win_subwin - pass prompt_for_name, form_win, form_subwin
    set_win_subwin_attrs - pass form_win, form_subwin
    display form window
LOOP
process_input(ch); return 1 on complete/proceed
validation?
LOOP
set_name;
free_mem
draw_mesg(char username[]);

The trick here is to do all of the work creating the form in a separate
function (that's the intended approach in the game). Separate functions or
macros may be used to process the interaction, the submitted value, etc.
Validation confuses me -- seems like its automatic. let's play with it and
find out!

main
*****
char username[];
initialize curses
draw_form()
LOOP
process_input(ch); return 1 on complete/proceed
set_name;
LOOP
draw_mesg(char username[]);

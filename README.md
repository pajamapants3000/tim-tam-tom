A tic-tac-toe game in curses

Should be fairly easy to build on any properly-configured Linux system with
NCurses (which, I would think, should be any Linux system!).

Just run `make`.

I hope to get a Windows build at some point that is reliable. I have gotten
it to work before, but it's not as clean as I would like it. Perhaps using
pdcurses in place of NCurses... I don't know.
